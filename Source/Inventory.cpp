/*
 * The goal of {inventory} is to store pointers that point to Item objects and also
 * pointers that point to objects of classes derived from Item, this in a way to
 * avoid the Slicing Object.
 *
 * To work with a pointer that points to an object different from the Item class,
 * (i.e. an object built using a derived class), it is necessary to realize
 * a "cast", however the correct way to realize this "cast" is with
 * the keyword dynamic_cast.
 *
 * A reason for this could be given in the definition of David Rodriguez:
 *
 * Define of dynamic_cast:
 *
 *      "Given a class Base of which there is a derived class
 *      Derived, dynamic_cast will convert a Base pointer to
 *      a Derived pointer if and only if the actual object
 *      pointed at is in fact a Derived object."

 *                  - Question - 2253168 - Feb 2010
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *      If there is an index in the array (i.e. {inventory}) that stores a Shield
 *      type object (derived from Item) it is necessary to realize a dynamic_cast
 *      to work with the returned pointer, just like this:
 *
 *      >>> Shield *shield = dynamic_cast< Shield * > (inventory.getItemInIndex( int ));
 *
 * It is necessary to emphasize that if the pointer points to an Item type object
 * this "cast" is not necessary.
